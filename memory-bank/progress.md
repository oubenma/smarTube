# Progress: SmarTube Chrome Extension

## What Works (Implemented Features)
Based on the "Potential Improvements" section in `context.md` and the "Core Functionality" description, the following features are confirmed as implemented and working:

- **Core UI Injection:** The summary container (`#youtube-summary-container-ext`) is successfully injected into the YouTube video watch page's secondary column and is always visible upon injection.
- **Header Functionality:** Sticky header with "Video Summary" title and settings (⚙️) button. Clicking the header (excluding the settings button) toggles the visibility of the container's body and footer.
- **Settings Button:** Clicking the settings (⚙️) button correctly opens the extension's options page.
- **Summary Generation Trigger:** The "✨ Show Summary" button in the container body triggers summary generation.
- **Loading State:** A loading message replaces the summary button during generation.
- **API Interaction (Summary):** `content.js` sends video URL to `background.js`, which retrieves API keys/theme from `chrome.storage.sync`, fetches transcript (Supadata), generates summary (Gemini), and sends Markdown summary/error back.
- **Markdown Rendering:** `content.js` converts Markdown summaries to HTML using Showdown.js and displays them.
- **API Key Missing Error:** Displays an error message with instructions if API keys are missing.
- **Q&A Interface:** Sticky footer with textarea input ("Ask about this video...") and send button (➤).
- **Q&A Submission:** Typing a question and pressing Enter (or clicking send) clears input, appends user question, appends "Thinking..." placeholder.
- **API Interaction (Q&A):** `content.js` sends question/URL to `background.js`, which fetches transcript (if needed), calls Gemini API for Q&A, and sends answer/error back.
- **Q&A Display:** `content.js` updates "Thinking..." placeholder with received answer/error, maintaining chat format.
- **Dynamic Navigation Handling:**
    - Detects URL changes using History API listeners (`pushState`, `popstate`).
    - Extracts and tracks video ID to detect actual video changes.
    - Existing container is properly cleared and removed using direct DOM manipulation.
    - Fresh container injected for new video after delay.
    - Event listeners and state are reset for new video context.
    - MutationObserver monitors URL changes for reliable dynamic navigation.
- **Theme Selection:** Auto/Light/Dark options, with "Auto" matching YouTube's theme.
- **Container Behavior Setting:** Option to start the container in a collapsed state.
- **Options Page Functionality:**
    - Manages Gemini API key.
    - Manages multiple Supadata API keys (add, list, activate, delete, rate-limit indicator).
    - Language selection dropdown for summaries.
    - Saves all preferences to `chrome.storage.sync`.
    - Handles theme switching with system preference detection and sends updates to active tabs.
- **Options Page Dark Mode:** Full dark mode support with system sync, consistent UI, CSS variables, smooth transitions, proper contrast, and dark-themed form controls.
- **Extension Icon Action:** Clicking the extension icon directly opens the options page.
- **Font Size Customization:** For answers in the container.
- **Arabic Language Support:** Improved text alignment and display.

## What's Left to Build
Based on the provided `context.md`, it appears that all core functionalities and identified improvements have been implemented. The document does not explicitly list any remaining features or known issues that are currently outstanding.

## Current Status
The SmarTube Chrome Extension is feature-complete as per the `context.md` description. It provides robust video summarization and Q&A capabilities, with a well-integrated UI, secure API key management, and comprehensive handling of YouTube's dynamic navigation.

## Known Issues
No known issues are explicitly mentioned in the `context.md` file. Potential future challenges might arise from changes to YouTube's DOM structure or API rate limit policies, but these are not current "known issues" within the existing implementation.
